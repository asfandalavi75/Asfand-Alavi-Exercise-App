Prob. 1.
Implement  the following  Boolean  function  I’, together with  the don’t-care conditions ri,
using no more thun two NOR b'otos:
F(A,  B, C,  D)  = 2(2, 4,  tl, 12. 14,)
d [A,  B, C,  D)  = 2((1, 1, 5, 8)
Assume that hoth the normal and complement inputs are available.

Prob. 2.

With the use of maps, find the simplest sum-of-products form of the function F = f.g, where
f  =  abc’ + c'd  + a'cd’ + b'cd’
and      g = (a + b + c’ + d’) (b’ + c’ + d) (a’ + c + d’)

Prob. 3.
Implement  the following four l3oolcan expressions with  three half  Bidders:
ii   ——  A 9b R  96 C
£ =  A’  BC.  +   AB’  C
N =  AB C.’  +   (A’         B’)  C
G =  AB C.

(15 pts)    Prob. 4.
Design a combinational circuit with three ioputgz,y,and z,and three outputs,@ B,  and C. When the 
binary input is 0,1,2, or 3,thebinary output is one greater than the input.When the binary input is 
4, 5, 6, or Z the binary output is two fern than the input.
(15 pts)    Prob. 5.
Design a half-subtractor circuit with ippats z and y and outputs D    and By.The circuit
subtracts the bites—y and places the difference in D and the borrow in By.
(a)   Deaign a full-subtracts circuit with tlixee inputs z, y, Bp and two outputs DiJ  and
By.The cimuit subtracts z -y  —Mfg where By ñ the ipput borrow, By   ñ the output

(15 pts)     Prob. 6.

usr a‹t»ia ablema i6t›inary combinations of the four input variablezThen list
the binary valum for TJ through Z'2 and outpu'•^i and N2 in the table.
(15 pts)    Prob. 7.
Dbtain the simplified Boolean expressions for output F and G in terms of  the input variables in 
the circuit of       P4J.
